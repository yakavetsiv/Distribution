The script was develloped for ImageJ to estimate the penetration profiles of fluorophores in tumor spheroids. The macros draws concentric circles
and estimate the mean intensity for each rim obtained. 

1. To install the macros: Open Fiji ImageJ - Plugins - Marcos - Install.

2. Before to use the macros you need to open the image and draw oval selection. 
3. To run the macros: Plugins - Macros - spheroids_penetration_profile

The resolution (n) should be asjusted depending on the size and resolution of image in order to reduce the noise.
