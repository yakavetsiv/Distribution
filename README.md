The script was develloped for ImageJ to estimate the penetration profiles of fluorophores in tumor spheroids. The macros draws concentric circles and estimate the mean intensity for each rim obtained. 

## Installation

To install the macros: Open Fiji ImageJ - Plugins - Marcos - Install.

## Usage
Before to use the macros you need to open the image and draw oval selection. 
To run the macros: Plugins - Macros - spheroids_penetration_profile

The resolution (n) should be asjusted depending on the size and resolution of image in order to reduce the noise.
