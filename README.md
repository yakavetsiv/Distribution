# Penetration profiles
The script was develloped for ImageJ to estimate the penetration profiles of fluorophores in tumor spheroids. The macros draws concentric circles and estimate the mean intensity for each rim obtained. 

## Installation

To install the macros: Open Fiji ImageJ - Plugins - Marcos - Install.

## Usage
1. Open the image
1. Draw oval selection (ROI)
1. Run the macro (Plugins - Macros - spheroids_penetration_profile)
1. Export the data (Data - Save data or Data - Copy data set)

The resolution (n) should be asjusted depending on the size and resolution of image in order to reduce the noise.

To change the resolution: 
1.  Open macro editing mode: Plugins - Marcos - Edit
1. Change n value
1. Save the script
