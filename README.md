Some simple macros for Fiji/ImageJ that we are using in the lab.

Most of these tools are available via the quantixed ImageJ update site. Instructions for how to follow a 3rd party update site are here. This is the best way to install these macros and maintain the latest versions.

If you want to install manually, add the contents of macros and scripts to the corresponding directories in your Fiji/ImageJ installation.

After installation, all macros can be found under the menu item called LabCode.
